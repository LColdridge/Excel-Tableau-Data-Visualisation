# Excel Tableau Data Visualisation
For this project, I used an open source dataset on the Wealth of the Nations, which includes worksheets on GDP per capita, Life Expectancy at Birth, and Smartphone Users Worldwide. I formatted the data in Excel, created a worksheet with filtered data, and produced a dashboard within Tableau based on some of my tables in the Excel dataset.

# Data:
The Wealth of the Nations
Rank, Country, GDP per capita, Year of Information, Life Expectancy at Birth

# Objectives:
- Clean, format and filter the dataset using Excel
- Create a visual report that will show the data in the form of charts and maps using Tableau to the clients requirements
